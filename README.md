FFmpeg movie playback onto Cocos2d-x Sprite

Currently it's a work in progress, taken from other piece of software I did wrote.

Hopefully I'll update it into fully featured repo, with sample code, currently it's in "take it or leave it" state.

I'm using it to have cross-platform video playback in my cocos2d-x app.

also- audio decoding is not there... but it's easy to add.
